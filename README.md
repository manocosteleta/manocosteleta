# Hey there! 👋

My name is Manoel Costa. Glad you're here.

👀 **Interests:** I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies.

🌱 **Currently learning:** I'm sharpening my skills as a Backend Developer with ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?logo=java&logoColor=white) and ![Oracle SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle_SQL-F80000?logo=oracle&logoColor=white).

💞️ **Looking to collaborate:** I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects where I can contribute my expertise and learn from others.

😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him

⚡ **Fun fact:** When I was a kid, I dismantled my mom's wall clock and couldn't put it back together correctly. To this day, I wouldn't know how to assemble a clock, but the intense curiosity about how things work is a driving force behind my professional engagement.
