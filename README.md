# Hey there! 👋

My name is Manoel Costa. Glad you're here.

⚡ **Fun fact:** When I was a kid, I dismantled my mom's wall clock and couldn't put it back together correctly. To this day, I wouldn't know how to assemble a clock, but the intense curiosity about how things work is a driving force behind my professional engagement.
